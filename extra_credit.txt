=== Extra Credit ===

We implemented the extra credit in CP2, which had us implement functions to validate memory addresses.
The following are descriptions on what these functions are and instructions on how to test for functionality. 

== Memory Validation == 
The function memory_validate_vptr_len validates a virtual memory address range and checks for the required 
permission flags. The function memory_validate_vstr ensures that the virtual memory range is well-formed,
mapped, and meets the required umode and readable permission flags specified. 

We use these functions in our syscall functions, specifically in our sysfsopen, sysdevopen, sysread, and 
syswrite syscalls. They are used to verify file names and buf pointers. If these functions don't pass in the 
syscalls, then we return with a -EINVAL. 

We also see the effects of the extra functionality through our test case, 'test_extra_credit.c'. This test can be located
within the src/user directory. The exectuable for this file, 'test_extra_credit' is located in src/user/bin.
To run this test, change the INIT_PROC in main.c located in src/kern to 'test_extra_credit'.
