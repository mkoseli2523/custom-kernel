== CP1 Lost Points == 

We lost points because our shell wasn't running correctly, 
We lost a point on the set_pos function within our fs_ioctl. A variable was getting clobbered
because we weren't setting its type correctly, we casted it as an 'int' instead of a 'uint64_t'. You can see
that the bug is fixed because our 'test_locking' executable utilizes setpos. 


== CP2 Lost Points == 

We did not correctly recreate two of the faults to show proper paging implementation, so we rewrote the test
programs to showcase that. The tests we rewrote to showcase this are located in the src/kern/ directory. These 
programs are called 'test_non_readable.c' and 'test_non_writable.c'. To run these tests, go into the src/kern/
directory. 

Run the makefile using "make run-test_non_readable" to test "Reading from a page without read 
permissions". 

Run the makefile using "make run-test_non_writable" to test "Writing to a page without write permissions".
